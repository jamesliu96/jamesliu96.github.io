Glitter on the pavement
Silver on the bottom of my shoe
Platinum on the drain clog
Blow a hole right through you

Walking down the street so grand
I see a spot where I can stand
Lift my chin the moment's prime
With a sharp 呸 I'm feeling fine

There goes the phlegm you let go free
Little piece of you left history
Nature's call a primal urge
With a loud 呸 the tension's purged

Spitting on the ground ain't no crime
With a 呸 I'll mark my time
It's a signature a flair
With a 呸 I show I care

Fancy folks with too much pride
Hiding all they're feeling inside
Give a 呸 to all that fuss
Join the crowd and spit with us

Oldest act don't need a plan
A universal code for man
Bonding with the earth below
With a 呸 we're in the flow

Spit it out and feel the weight
Leave your stress ain't that just great
It’s the sound of sweet relief
With a 呸 share your belief

Excuse me?
Did you not see what I was eating?
How fuckin' rude
Common decency now is askew
Don't mean to be crass but fuck you
Eugh!
