It's a salt made from seaweed powder
Food tastes good 'cause it makes it louder
Umami bomb makes your taste buds cower
Light of my life and the love of the hour
All hail MSG

Naturally occurring in tomatoes and shellfish
Chemistry discovered it could grant my sole wish
Extracted from seaweed from the Japanese coast
The good
Good flavors start to come up close

So bring a load of algae and a ton of fresh water
Add some yeast and a few breadcrumbs
Salt 'til it's just right
Then dry it in the sun

It's a salt made from seaweed powder
Food tastes good 'cause it makes it louder
Umami bomb makes your taste buds cower
Life of my life and the love of the hour
It's a salt made from seaweed powder
Food tastes good does it make you prouder
Umami bomb lets your tongue devour
The raw delight of the purest chowder
All hail MSG
All hail MSG

MSG for cookies
MSG for turkey
MSG for chicken

MSG for sweet tatters
MSG for turnip greens
