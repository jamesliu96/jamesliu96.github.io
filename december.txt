It's that tinsel time
It's December
Where we hit rewind
And we all remember
Where we add up all the wins
And spend some time with all our kin
It's that tinsel time
It's December again

There's no news I ain't heard about it
Even Santa's in the trenches
Fightin' through it
Put out more milk and cookies this year
Oh wow
Hope it's over now

Maybe Christmas Day 2025
There'll be peace on Earth
But right now
We're on thin ice
This homemade pie doesn't cure these blues
Been tryin' on these soldier's shoes
Maybe Christmas Day 2025

Oh
Have you heard the news? I doubt it
Raisin' hell
Mainly raisin's all around it
This cinnamon ain't covered this year
Oh wow
Hope it's better now

All these London fires and Roman liars
San Francisco's water and hope retired
Carolina towns roamin' higher
Can't we all just get along?

It's that tinsel time
And it's crystal clear
We'll do it all again
As long as we're here
And if we make it through another year
We'll know how the hell if we got here

Livin' room full of rubble and a thin cheer
Should old acquaintance be forgotten now
Oh wow
Is it over now?

All these London fires and Roman liars
San Francisco's water and hope retired
Hangin' onto God overflowin' prior
Can't we all just get along?

All these London fires and Roman liars
San Francisco's water and hope retired
Hangin' onto God overflowin' prior
Can't we all just get along?
