Twenty twenty-four
A closing shutter door

The visionaries have
Picked up the money
Struck on the button
What’s left behind is
Gore!

Can’t you see
You’re yet free
To leave
Set these three
On fire:
The Liar!
The Tire!
The Empire!

I’m on my mission
Stay? No reason
Or there’s treason
Against myself
Me!
