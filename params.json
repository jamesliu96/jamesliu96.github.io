{"name":"JAMES LIU","tagline":"ABOUT ME","body":"# About Me\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n![Avatar](https://raw.github.com/jamesliu96/jamesliu96.github.io/master/images/avatar.jpg)\r\n\r\nMy name is **James Liu**, a programmer, a designer and also a student from China.\r\n\r\nI was born in 1996.\r\n\r\nI am now studying in the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University](http://www.rdfz.cn/).\r\n\r\nI have an cute puppy. Her name is **Furry**. (Sorry. she was _so cute_ that she ate her own photo... I have to take another later on)\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n\r\nI have been studying **Computer Science** for years, attending competitions and examinations during my study.\r\n\r\nI have the experience of **programming**.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n//language.<name>[0] \r\n// a bool value indicating if I am experienced at <name>.\r\n//language.<name>[1]\r\n// a numeric value indicating my first year doing <name>.\r\n\r\nlanguage = {\r\n    c_cpp:       [true, 2006],\r\n    objective_c: [true, 2011],\r\n    java:        [true, 2011],\r\n    python:      [true, 2012],\r\n    ruby:        [false, 2013],\r\n    scala:       [false, null]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Algorithms** are always important for me.\r\n\r\nI have been using C/C++ since when I was 10.\r\n\r\nI developed some interesting Apps on iOS and Android. Unfortunately I am not doing it now. (Maybe I'll catch up with it after high school)\r\n\r\nI did a project [Crypto-JS for Nodejs](https://github.com/jamesliu96/cryptojs) (first called \"Krypton\").\r\n\r\nI am also doing researches about Femtosecond Imaging with my tutor [Di Wu](http://web.media.mit.edu/~d_wu/) from both Tsinghua University.\r\n\r\nI love snakes and pythons! Here's my Python project [renren](https://github.com/jamesliu96/renren) - a Renren.com login and posting module with complete tests.\r\n\r\nI worked on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3 during 2009-2014.\r\n\r\nI am a loyal JSer. **JavaScript** is my meaning of life.\r\n\r\nMy recent HTML5 game **Flappy Mario** is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesliu96/flappy) ([Try](http://g.jamesliu.info/flappy))\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\n- Personal Email: jamesliu96 [at] 163.com\r\n- Business Email: james [at] jamesliu.info\r\n- Sina Weibo: [@Cloudy龟](http://weibo.com/jamesliu96)\r\n- Twitter: Cloudy Turtle [@jamesliu96](https://twitter.com/jamesliu96)\r\n- Facebook: James Liu\r\n\r\nContact me if you would like to get more information.\r\n\r\n##### Copyright © 2014 James Liu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
