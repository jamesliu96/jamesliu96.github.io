Hi! Welcome!

My name is James Liu, a programmer and also a student from China.
I am now studying in the High School Affiliated to Renmin University.
I have an agile puppy. Her name is Furry.

I have been studying Computer Science for years, attending competitions and examinations during my study. I am used to program using C/C++, Objective-C, Python and Java. Algorithms are always important for me, thus I have taken lots of courses with some undergraduate students in Tsinghua University.However, I am using C/C++ for over 6 years (it''s been a long time but I still love them most).

I produced some interesting Apps on iOS platform. Unfortunately I am not doing it anymore.

Now, I am working on a project called Krypton which is an encrypted web platform of my own. It will soon be published to Github that means it will be an open source project.

I am also doing researches about Femtosecond Imaging with Di Wu from both Tsinghua University and MIT Media Lab.

I love Python!

I worked on HTML5 and Javascript during 2009-2012 and made some amazing progress in web designing.

I am a JSer. Javascript is my meaning of life.
